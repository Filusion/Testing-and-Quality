# Testing and Quality - Database Application with 2-3 Tree

This repository contains a database application for efficiently managing student records using **my own implementation of a 2-3 tree**.  

The application supports the following commands and operations on the student database:  

- `add` – Add a new student  
- `remove` – Remove a student  
- `find` – Search for a student  
- `count` – Count total students  
- `print` – Display all students  
- `save_file` – Save the database to a file  
- `restore_file` – Load the database from a file  
- `exit` – Exit the application  

## Testing

- The entire Java code is thoroughly tested using **JUnit** with almost 100% coverage.  
- Additional **system tests** are implemented in **Python** to verify end-to-end functionality.
